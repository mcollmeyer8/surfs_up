Module 9 - SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask

## Overview of the analysis
This analysis will discuss the key differences in weather between June and December in Oahu.
The goal is to help us determine whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
Looking at our analysis, we were able to pull some very interesting information.
- The mean temp in June is 75 degrees. The mean temp in Dec is 71 degrees.
- The minimum temp in June is 64 degrees, and in December it's 56.
- The max temp in June is 85 degrees, and the max temp in Dec is 83.

## Summary
Based on our analysis, there is every reason to believe that a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
It was no surprise that June would be a great month for business. What was a bit more surprising is how little the temps drop in Decemember.
It's definitely warm enough all year long for our surf and ice cream shop to be successful!
Additional information we could gather to help with our analysis would be:
- How many sunny days does this location average in June vs Dec?
- What are wind speed variations between June and Dec in this location?
